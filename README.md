<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repo contains all files related to Bachelor's Degree Project. 
It contains two applications and deployment manfiests for Kubernetes deplyoment. 

To monitor the proper functioning of applications based on the microservices architecture and dedicated for cloud deployment, traditional tools  are insufficient to diagnose applications in case of failure.  
</br>
In the first part of this project, we analyzed the different types of architectures (monolithic and microservices), the Kubernetes container orchestrator, and different monitoring/logging tools. The majority of these tools are projects of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. This part allowed the understanding and definition of a new concept called Observability. This new concept encompasses monitoring and logging, and adds to the latter two the collection of different metrics. </br>
In a second part, two observable systems were presented and deployed. The first system allowed us to test the observability tools in an environment that simulates a production application. On the other hand, the second system has been developed, presented and deployed in order to extend the observability layer from the infrastructure layer to the application layer using the same tools. These two systems allow us to conclude the effectiveness of the tools presented in the first part.
